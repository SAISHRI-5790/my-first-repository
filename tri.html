      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23rd January 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa. His father, Janakinath Bose, was a lawyer by profession, and his mother, Prabhabati, belonged to the family of Dutts of Hatkhola. Bose was the ninth child of his parents.
He completed his primary education at Protestant European School, where students followed the Western Education system. He was introduced to the Bible, Latin, good manners, British geography, and British history.No Indian languages were taught as a part of the curriculum. He continued his studies at Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack, where Bengali and Sanskrit were taught. His dedication and focus on studies earned him a second position in the matriculation exam at Calcutta University.
After learning Philosophy from the Presidency College of Calcutta in 1913, he passed his Bachelor of Arts with honours in Philosophy from Scottish Church College at the University of Calcutta. The ideas of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda on the “doctrine of selfless living” and service to humanity influenced him to the core.
After completing higher education at Cambridge University, he passed the Covenant Civil Services Examination in August 1920. But, the nationalist turbulence in India prompted him to resign from Civil Services in April 1921. He returned to India in June 1921, leaving behind his dream to join the Indian Civil Services(ICS).</p>

Bose was inclined to socialism and revolutionism, rather than the pacifistic methodologies advocated by Mahatma Gandhi. He gave a new impetus to the Non-Cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, and Gandhi placed him at the forefront of Indian Nationalism in Bengal.</p>
